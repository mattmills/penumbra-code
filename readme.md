###Penumbra's Code

In the book [Mr Penumbra's 24 Hour book store](http://www.robinsloan.com/penumbra/), one of the main plot points is a code involving substitution of a given text with numbers notched into the glyphs of a typeface. It sounded pretty simple, so I started coding a version on the flight home. If you're clever with letter frequencies, and the number of glyphs modulo 26 is near 13, you can make this rather clever. 

Note that I have no association with Mr. Sloan, other than being a fan. I'm building this so I can do some cryptanalysis of the cypher; I think that as described in the book it wouldn't take much to break.
